0.7.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New plugin 'launchtaskbar' with combined functionality from 'launchbar'
    and 'taskbar'. For easy support codebase is merged instead of doing
    duplicates but appearance is still the same in dependency from mode
    chosen.
* Integrated with LibFM, all launching and application selection in the
    launchbar settings is done by LibFM now.
* New simpler plugins API implementation, using LibFM plugins loader. In
    new API some callbacks were simplified and some removed, see all the
    detailed descriptions in the file plugin.h.
* New plugins are GtkWidgets now, therefore there is no explicit destroy
    for them or their data, all will be handled implicitly.
* Changed config access with simple API similar to libconfig one.
* Using icon caching from LibFM.
* Applications properties in the menu are managed by LibFM API, no more
    calls to lxshortcut application.
* Setting for file manager is not handled on its own but XDG setting is
    used now, i.e. default choice for "inode/directory" MIME type.
* Setting for terminal is handled by LibFM, therefore it is the same as
    in PCManFM now, no own setting anymore.
* Replaced configure option --enable-cast-checks with --enable-debug.
* Replaced 'pager' plugin with former 'wnckpager' one. The 'wnckpager'
    name is still supported for compatibility but it is the same plugin.
* Added new plugin 'weather', written by Piotr Sipika.
* Using drag & drop handling from LibFM in launchbar. It is possible now
    to use any kind of files as launchbuttons, and folders can receive
    drops as well.
* Allowed drag applications from system menu plugin so they now can be
    dropped somewhere. The obvious example is drop on the desktop.
* Using human readable sensor names if available (like 'Core 0', etc.).
* Panel is allowed to hide completely (setting width when hidden to 0).
* The IconGrid converted into GtkContainer derived class PanelIconGrid.
* Allowed to use <USER_CONFIG_DIR>/lxpanel/<profile>/gtkrc for the panel
    custom style setup.
* The panel itself in not a struct now but a GtkWindow derived class so
    no special API to destroy it is required.
* Improved the layout of icons in panel, they will not align to the edge
    of screen but appropriately to panel height. Some of them did that
    already but some were aligned to the screen edge without any gap.
* The button to configure plugin in panel plugins configuration tab is
    renamed from 'Edit' to 'Properties'.
* All logging is unified. The option --log is deprecated and isn't used
    anymore. User can change logs appearance using G_MESSAGES_DEBUG and
    G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED environment variables (see GLib docs).
* Old APIs are in place still for backward compatibility with third party
    plugins but will be dropped later, supposedly on next feature release
    point. Old APIs are not present in public headers, compatibility is
    on binary level only.
* A whole lot of bugfixes.
