LXPanel is a lightweight X11 desktop panel.

To install this program, two other packages are needed:
  menu-cache, lxmenu-data.
Please install them before installing lxpanel.

There are 2 programs contained in the package.

1. lxpanel: the panel

2. lxpanelctl: the controller of lxpanel, can be used to control lxpanel in 
               other programs.  The best place to use lxpanelctl is by far 
               the numerous key bindings provided by window managers.
               When the key combination is pressed, call lxpanelctl to popup
               system menu, or to open run dialog in lxpanel.
               Run lxpanelctl without any argument to see what command it 
               currently recognizes.
