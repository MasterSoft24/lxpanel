Description: a lightweight desktop panel for X
 LXPanel is a lightweight GTK+ 2.x based desktop panel which is a 
 derivative work from fbpanel with following features:
  * User-friendly application menu automatically generated from .desktop
    files on the system.
  * Launcher bar (small icons clicked to launch apps).
  * Task bar supporting urgency hint (can be flash when gaim gets new
    incoming messages).
  * Run dialog (a dialog let you type a command and run, can be called
    in external programs).
  * Net status icon plug-in (optional).
  * Volume control plug-in (optional).
  * Notification area (system tray).
  * Digital clock.
  * Keyboard LEDs plug-in (display caps/num locks).
  * lxpanelctl, an external controller let you control lxpanel in
    other programs. For example, "lxpanelctl run" will show the Run
    dialog in lxpanel, and "lxpanelctl menu" will show the application
    menu. This is useful in key bindings provided by window managers.
